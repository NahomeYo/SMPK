The mother who could not have children would pray in front of St. Mary's icon, tearfully asking to be blessed with a child. Once while she was praying this prayer, she heard an \"Amen\". Thus when she finally had a son, she named him \"Mina\".\n                                    St. Mina's father, Audexios, held an important position in the Roman Empire. When he died Mina was but fourteen years old. St. Mina then joined the army, and was given a very high position due to his father's prominence. St. Mina was sent by the army to Algeria to serve his country.\n                                    Strongly desiring to serve God rather than his country, he resigned from the army after three short years and devoted his entire life to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>\n                                <p className=\"introduction\">St. Mina became a hermit leaving everything to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. While a hermit, he saw visions of heavenly angels crowning martyrs with beautiful and glorious crowns. One day as St. Mina was contemplating his visions; he heard a voice say, \"Blessed are you, Abba Mina, because you have been called for the pious life from your childhood. You shall be granted three crowns; one for your celibacy, the second for your asceticism, and the third because you will be martyred.\"</p>\n                                <p className=\"introduction\">Following this St. Mina was overwhelmed by a great desire to live in Heaven. In true faith and with devotion in his heart, he went to the Roman ruler declaring that he was a Christian. St. Mina was severely tortured with endless sufferings. His suffering attracted many pagans not only to Christianity but to martyrdom as well.\n                                    The saint's hardhearted assassins tried to burn his young body but the fire had no effect upon it. Obtaining his discarded body, some Christian believers placed it upon the back of a camel and set out for the Western Desert. While on this journey, the camel suddenly stopped at a certain spot in the desert and could not forcibly be made to move. St. Mina was buried in this particular area. His present monastery marks this spot today at the end of the Lake of Marriute, close to the City of Alexandria.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div style={{ position: 'relative', display: \"flex\", alignItems: \"start\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}>\n                            <img src={SM} style={{ position: 'relative', padding: 0, margin: 0, height: \"min-content\" }} alt=\"stMina\" />\n                        </div>\n                    </span>\n\n                    <p className=\"introduction\">Several years after his burial, shepherds were tending their sheep at this location and a very sick little lamb fell to the ground. The shepherds were astonished that the sickly little lamb after falling on this particular spot raised itself completely cured. The story quickly spread throughout the countryside and many sick people came to the spot where the small lamb was cured. Just simply lying on this spot cured many.</p>\n                </span>\n\n                <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: 'var(--space)' }}>\n                    <Title service=\"Pope Saint Kyrillos VI (Cyril VI)\" time=\"116th Pope of Alexandria\" crossFill=\"var(--sixthly)\" h2Color=\"var(--sixthly)\" textSize=\"1.25rem\" />\n\n                    <span style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr' }}>\n                        <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: 'var(--space)' }}>\n                            <p className='introduction'>Pope Kyrillos the 6th was born on August 2nd, 1902 – named Azer Youssef Atta to a God – loving family rooted in prayer and service in Damanhour, Egypt.  At a very young age, Azer was attracted to the beauty of holiness and solitude.  It was said that he had the majority of the Gospel of St. John memorized at a very early age in which he would happily recite the beautiful verses to his teachers and classmates, who ended up picking them up themselves.\n                                When Azer was only about 7 years of age, his mother Esther, passed away.  And she gave him a very interesting gift before her passing.  That gift was an introduction to <q>St. Mina the Martyr & Wonderworker.</q></p>\n                            <p className=\"introduction\">Azer continued in the love of God and was called to the monastic life in 1927 at the Baramous Monastery where he was ordained with the name Fr. Mina El-Baramousy.   Interestingly, the name Mina that he was named after was not the same St. Mina the Martyr and Wonderworker that he loved.  He was named after St. Mina the monk.  But we can only help to realize that the name Mina was chasing after him.  Fr. Mina El-Baramousy continued to grow strong in spirit and God gave him a multitude of talents in which the most popular of them are the gift of performing miracles. He is not considered a saint because of this God-given talent but, he is a saint because of his level of holiness and his great love for God. In his life, his virtues that gave him the ability of carrying out miracles by the name of God, was his life of prayer. </p>\n                            <p className=\"introduction\"> In 1944, while Fr. Mina was considered an urban monk living in St. Mina’s church in Old Cairo in which he built, he was appointed as the Head of the monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor.  During this time, students would come to him to get his spiritual guidance.  Among the students were known people such as the future Pope Shenouda III, the future Fr. Matthew the Poor, the future Bishop Domadios of Giza, and the future Bishop Athanasius of Beni-Seuf, who were all vitally important in the Sunday School Movement which would prove to be instrumental in the revitalization of the Coptic Orthodox Church. </p>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>\n                            <img src={PK} style={{ position: 'absolute', top: '50%', left: '50%', transform: \"translate(-50%, -50%)\", padding: 0, margin: 0 }} alt=\"stMina\" />\n                        </div>\n                    </span>\n\n                    <p className=\"introduction\"> In 1959, Fr. Mina the Hermit was ordained as Pope Kyrillos the 6th, the 116th Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church.  In his 12 years as a Pope, Pope Kyrillos the 6th became the lighthouse of the church, reflecting the Light of God throughout all his work and service. He reinstituted the importance of theological and spiritual knowledge in the churches and monasteries.  He renovated the glorious monasteries of the Egyptian deserts and the cathedral of St. Mark the Evangelist in Cairo.  He brought back the relics of St. Mark from Italy, and he established churches in the United States of America, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Africa.  Additionally, during his time as Pope, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared for all to see her on April 2nd, 1968 at St. Mary Coptic Orthodox Church in Zeitoun, Egypt. </p>\n                    <p className=\"introduction\"> Our father, St. Kyrillos the 116th Pope of the Church of Alexandria departed to the Heavenly Jerusalem on March 9th, 1971 and was canonized as a Saint in the Coptic Orthodox Church on June 20th, 2013. May his prayers be with us all.
